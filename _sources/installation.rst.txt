Package Requirements
====================

Currently there are no strict criteria for installation; it is suggested that you use the most up-to-date package versions available. The one exception there is that development is currently focused on Python 3.7.

The current package requirements are:

* ``numpy``
* ``scipy``
* ``astropy``

and for running the test suite

* ``tox``
* ``sphinx-fortran``
* ``sphinx-astropy``
* ``pytest-astropy``.

Additionally, you will need the following to install ``macauff``:

* ``gfortran`` -- at least version 8
* ``git``

Installing the Package
======================

As of now, the only way to install this package is by downloading it from the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/Onoddil/macauff>`_. We recommend using an `Anaconda Distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_, or `miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_, to maintain specific, independent Python installations without the need for root permissions.

Once you have installed your choice of conda, then you can create an initial conda environment::

	conda create -n your_environment_name python=3.7 numpy scipy astropy

although you can drop the ``=3.7``, or chose another (later) Python version, if you desire to do so. Then activate this as our Python environment::

	conda activate your_environment_name

If you require the additional test packages listed above, for running tests, you can install them separately with::

	conda install -c conda-forge tox sphinx-astropy pytest-astropy
	conda install -c vacumm -c conda-forge sphinx-fortran

You will also need to install ``gfortran`` in order to compile the fortran code in this package. Instructions for how to install this for Windows, MacOS, or Linux can be found `here <https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries>`_. Finally, install ``git`` if you do not have it on your computer; `instructions <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`_ for installing it on your operating system are available.

Once you have the required packages installed -- whether in a new ``conda`` environment or otherwise -- you can clone the repository::

	git clone git://github.com/onoddil/macauff.git

which will place the repository in the folder from which you invoked the ``git`` command. Now, from inside the folder that was just created (``cd macauff`` or equivalent), you can either run::

	pip install .

which will install ``macauff`` such that you can ``import macauff`` from other folders on your computer. However, if this is to develop the software, your changes will not be reflected in the installed version of the code (and you must re-install using the above command); if you wish to have changes immediately reflected in your ``pip``-installed version of the software, you can install ``macauff`` using::

	pip install -e .

where ``-e`` is the "editable" flag.

To confirm your installation was successful, you can ``import macauff`` in a Python terminal.

Testing
=======

To run the main unit test suite, assuming you installed it during the above process, you can run::

	tox -e test

If you wish to locally build the documentation -- mostly likely if you are improving or extending the documentation, as the docs are available online -- you can run::

	tox -e build_docs
